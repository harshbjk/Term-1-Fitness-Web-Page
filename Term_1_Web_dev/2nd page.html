        <h3>Carbohydrates</h3>
        <p>Carbohydrates are the primary energy source for workouts.
            Carbohydrates consumed before a workout fuels your body until your body starts to break down fats.
            Carbohydrates you eat after workout help you repair damaged cells, makes your body fit for the next workout and
            keeps your body from breaking down muscular proteins. Carbohydrates are a problem for most of us because we consume too
            many of them and must store the surplus. You can power activities, mend muscle cells, and enjoy a bright,
            alert brain without gaining weight if you eat just enough carbohydrates.</p>
        <h3>Proteins</h3>
        <p>Proteins are necessary for muscle growth and repair, hormone production, red blood cell production, and immune
            system maintenance. After a workout, eating protein helps your muscles
            heal and develop stronger. In an emergency circumstance, such as
            hunger or malnutrition, the body will only use protein for fuel.
            If you don't eat for a long time, your body will rely on its internal
            protein stores to keep you alive (fueling metabolic activities and
            forming red blood cells). In other words, if you don't eat any protein,
            your body will break down muscle tissue to obtain the protein it requires.</p>
        <h3>Fats</h3>
        <p>
            Fats keep you full, can be utilised as fuel, carry fat-soluble vitamins, and are necessary for hormone production, but you should keep your daily fat
            intake to around 25% of your total calories.
        </p>
        <h3>Micronutrients</h3>
        <p>
            Micronutrients, or vitamins and minerals in your diet, protect your body from oxidative damage,
            support your immune system, aid in food metabolization, and act as catalysts in millions of chemical events.

            Your performance, attractiveness, and overall health are all at danger if you are deficient
            in crucial nutrients.
